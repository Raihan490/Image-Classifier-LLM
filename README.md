Image-Classifier-LLM

🤖🖼️ Machine Learning Image Classifier with Gradio

This project uses Gradio to create a simple and interactive image classification app powered by a pre-trained ResNet-18 model from Hugging Face.

In the notebook, you will see:

📦 Importing and loading a pretrained computer vision model
🧠 A classify_image() function that processes an uploaded image and predicts its label
🖥️ A Gradio Interface that lets users upload any image and instantly see the model’s prediction
🚀 A one-click .launch() to run the app locally

In this challenge, I used the AI/LLM skills I learned from the Hugging Face Course by Jose Portilla to successfully complete the project.

This type of image classification technology is also important for future Mars exploration, where AI systems may help identify terrain, detect hazards, classify rocks, and assist autonomous rovers in navigation.

To use this, download the file and ensure you have all the necessary libraries listed in the first cell (starting with import...).
This is an example of my project running:
