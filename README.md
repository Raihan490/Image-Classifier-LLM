# Image-Classifier-LLM

🤖🖼️ Machine Learning Image Classifier with Gradio

This project uses Gradio to create a simple and interactive image classification app powered by a pre-trained ResNet-18 model from Hugging Face.

In the notebook, you will see:

📦 Importing and loading a pretrained computer vision model

🧠 A classify_image() function that processes an uploaded image and predicts its label

🖥️ A Gradio Interface that lets users upload any image and instantly see the model’s prediction

🚀 A one-click .launch() to run the app locally

In this challenge I had to use all the AI/LLM skills I learnt from the Hugging Face Course from Jose Portilla to succesfully finish this project.

To use this you can download the file, make sure you have all the nessecary libraries which is in the first cell starting with import...
This is an example of my Project running
