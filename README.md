# Image-Classifier-LLM

🤖🖼️ Machine Learning Image Classifier with Gradio

This project uses Gradio to create a simple and interactive image classification app powered by a pre-trained ResNet-18 model from Hugging Face.

In the notebook, you will see:

📦 Importing and loading a pretrained computer vision model

🧠 A classify_image() function that processes an uploaded image and predicts its label

🖥️ A Gradio Interface that lets users upload any image and instantly see the model’s prediction

🚀 A one-click .launch() to run the app locally

In this challenge I had to use all the AI/LLM skills I learnt from the Hugging Face Course from Jose Portilla to succesfully finish this project.
